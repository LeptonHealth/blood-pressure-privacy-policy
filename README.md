    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated"><strong>Last updated:</strong> [Insert Date]</p>

    <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>[App Name]</strong> (“we,” “our,” or “us”) collects,
        uses, and protects information when you use our mobile application (the “App”).
    </p>

    <p>
        By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>1.1 Personal Information</h3>
    <p>
        We do not require users to create an account and do not collect personally identifiable information
        such as name, email address, phone number, or physical address.
    </p>

    <h3>1.2 Health and Fitness Data</h3>
    <p>The App allows users to manually record and track the following health data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Blood pressure</li>
        <li>Blood sugar</li>
        <li>Heart rate</li>
        <li>Weight</li>
        <li>Height</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        In addition, the App can measure heart rate using the device camera and fingertip detection
        (photoplethysmography). This measurement is performed locally on the device.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Important:</strong><br>
        All health data is entered or generated solely for user self-monitoring purposes.
        The App does not diagnose, treat, or provide medical advice.
    </p>

    <h3>1.3 Device and Usage Data</h3>
    <p>
        We may collect limited, non-personal technical information, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device model</li>
        <li>Android version</li>
        <li>App version</li>
        <li>Crash logs</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This data is used strictly to improve app functionality and reliability.
    </p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>We use collected data only to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Display health records and trends to the user</li>
        <li>Enable app features such as charts, history, and statistics</li>
        <li>Improve app performance and user experience</li>
        <li>Fix bugs and prevent crashes</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        We do not use health data for advertising or profiling.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>
        All health records are stored locally on the user’s device unless explicitly stated otherwise.
        We implement reasonable security measures to protect stored data.
    </p>

    <p>
        Users are responsible for securing their devices (for example, by enabling screen lock or encryption).
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>
        We do not sell, rent, or share user data with third parties.
    </p>

    <p>
        Data may be disclosed only if required by law, regulation, or valid legal process.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Permissions Used by the App</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Camera</strong> – Used exclusively for heart rate measurement via fingertip detection</li>
        <li><strong>Storage (optional)</strong> – To save or export reports if the user chooses</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Permissions are used only for their stated purpose and can be revoked at any time through device settings.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Medical Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>
        The App is not a medical device and is not intended to replace professional medical advice,
        diagnosis, or treatment.
    </p>

    <p>
        Always consult a qualified healthcare professional regarding any medical condition.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        The App is not intended for children under the age of 13.
        We do not knowingly collect data from children.
    </p>

    <h2>8. User Rights</h2>
    <p>
        Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to access or delete your data.
        Since data is stored locally on the device, users maintain full control over their information.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
        Any changes will be posted within the App or on the app store listing.
