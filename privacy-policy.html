The App allows users to manually record and track the following health data:

In addition, the App can measure heart rate using the device camera and fingertip detection (photoplethysmography). This measurement is performed locally on the device.

Display health records and trends to the user

Enable app features (charts, history, statistics)

Improve app performance and user experience

Fix bugs and prevent crashes

We do not use health data for advertising or profiling.

3. Data Storage and Security

All health records are stored locally on the user’s device unless explicitly stated otherwise.

We implement reasonable security measures to protect stored data.

Users are responsible for securing their devices (screen lock, encryption).

We do not guarantee absolute security, but we take appropriate measures consistent with industry standards.

4. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell, rent, or share user data with third parties.

Data may be disclosed only if required by law, regulation, or valid legal process.

Permissions are used only for their stated purpose and can be revoked at any time via device settings.

The App is not a medical device and is not intended to replace professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

Always consult a qualified healthcare professional regarding any medical condition.

7. Children’s Privacy

The App is not intended for children under the age of 13.

8. User Rights

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to:
